## Binary Search Tree

A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a hierarchical data structure used for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations. Each node in the BST has a value, and nodes to the left have values less than the current node, while nodes to the right have values greater than the current node.

## Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, indicating that the list is sorted.

## Circular Queue

A Circular Queue is a data structure that allows efficient insertion and deletion of elements. It is implemented as a circular buffer and is particularly useful in scenarios where a fixed-size queue with a circular behavior is needed.

## Doubly Linked List

A Doubly Linked List is a linear data structure in which each node contains a data element and two pointers, one pointing to the previous node and one pointing to the next node. This allows for efficient traversal in both directions.

## Insertion Sort

Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort, but it has some advantages for small lists or lists that are partially sorted.

## Linked List

A Linked List is a linear data structure consisting of a sequence of elements, where each element points to the next element in the sequence. Linked lists provide efficient insertion and deletion of elements at any position within the list.

## Queue

A Queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. Elements are added at the rear end and removed from the front end. Queues are commonly used in various applications, such as scheduling tasks and managing resources.

## Queue Using Linked List

A Queue implemented using a Linked List is an efficient way to create a queue data structure. It combines the benefits of both linked lists and queues, providing fast enqueue and dequeue operations.

## Selection Sort

Selection Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly selects the minimum element from an unsorted portion of the list and moves it to the sorted portion. It has a time complexity of O(n^2) but is easy to understand and implement.

## Stack

A Stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. Elements are added and removed from the same end, known as the top. Stacks are used in various applications, such as function call management in programming and expression evaluation.
